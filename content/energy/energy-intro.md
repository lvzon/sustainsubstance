We live in interesting times. Humanity has never had as much energy at its disposal as we have had over the last half century or so. Given this abundance of cheap energy, our complex societies have flourished, but they have also become increasingly dependent on its availability. However, things are changing. Fossil energy is becoming increasingly expensive, and the negative side-effects of burning large amounts of fossil fuels are becoming apparent. The past few years have been the warmest years on record, and computer models predict that this global warming of the Earth's surface and atmosphere may have serious effects on regional climates for centuries to come. More worryingly, recent observations of polar ice caps show that warming actually is proceeding much faster than predicted by most models. In an international effort to slow climate change, a large group of countries signed the Paris climate accords last year. Many of these countries basically committed themselves to phasing out all atmospheric emissions from fossil fuels by 2050. Some countries see this as an economic opportunity. China for instance is positioning itself as the leading provider of alternative energy infrastructure, investing billions in industries that can produce solar panels, windmills and long-distance energy transportation networks. As a result of this, the cost of electricity generated from solar energy and wind power has dropped in recent years, reaching levels that are attractive for large-scale production. At the same time, all major car brands have announced plans to shift their production almost entirely toward electric vehicles. Yet, we're only at the start of a transition away from fossil energy, and many serious challenges remain on our way. The United States, globally the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, has recently elected a government that has vowed to actively promote the use of fossil fuels and to suppress government-funded research on climate change. Perhaps more seriously, few people realise how much fossil energy we actually use, especially in the "industrialised" countries. While scaling up alternative energy sources to this level is theoretically possible, it is certainly not going to be easy, especially not in the short term. Some time ago I started researching and writing an article on the challenges ahead, and on possible ways of overcoming them. This gradually evolved into an article series, in which I try to shed some light on our current energy use, and on the possible shape of the energy transition ahead. This is the first article in the series, in which I shall look at how much energy we use, where it comes from and how things came to be this way.
  
Things might get slightly technical at times, but you can safely skip such sections, as I will try to recap the important points at the end of each article. There will also be numbers. I will try to explain without numbers where I can, but the numbers are actually crucial. The energy problem, as we shall see, is mainly a problem of scale, and scale is determined by numbers. Specifically, big numbers.


#### A brief history of energy

As I already suggested in the introduction, we live in a rather unique period in history. Not only do we have more energy at our disposal as ever before, energy has also never been as cheap as it has been over the last century or so. Granted, energy prices have fluctuated quite a bit during this period, as you can see in the oil price chart below. As recently as 2011, the price of crude oil was at an almost historic high. At $0.74 per litre, the oil price in 2011 was more than ten times that in 1970! But we easily forget that oil actually contains *a lot* of energy. A convenient measure of energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), which I will explain in a bit, but which you may recognise from your electricity bills. A litre of oil contains roughly 10 kWh of energy, so even the extremely high 2011 oil price translates to a mere 7 dollar-cents per kWh, which, in the grand scheme of things, is really not that much.[^energyprices]

Fact is that *we all have become rather dependent on energy being so cheap*, because we use an incredible amount of it, especially in industrialised countries. In many ways, this abundance of cheap energy is a good thing. Energy quite literally powers everything we do. Things like food production, transport, heating and cooling become a lot easier and cheaper with abundant energy, and modern communication wouldn't even be possible without it. So what exactly is the problem? 

Take a look at the following graph, which shows how much energy we humans use per day, and where it comes from, from 1800 until the present day. (These are fairly rough estimates, expressed in terawatt-hours, a unit which I shall explain in a moment.)

![]({filename}/images/energy-timeseries-total-per-day.png)

Until about 1850, people mostly used biomass (stuff directly derived from plants or animals) as an energy source. Things like cooking, heating and lighting were done using wood, charcoal, peat, dung and whale-oil. Transport and agriculture were mostly powered by animals, mainly horses, mules and cattle. Wind and water played an important role as well, in industry (think windmills and watermills) and in long-distance transport (think sailing ships).

By 1850 the Industrial Revolution was well on its way. The Industrial Revolution was as much about technical innovation as it was about social change and energy transition: The technological developments were intimately tied to the availability of cheap labour and the large-scale mining of fossil coal. But the use of coal was still mostly limited to cities, to industry and to steam locomotives and ships. In 1850, firewood was still and by far the most important energy source for humanity. 

By 1900, the use of coal had grown to be more or less equal to the use of biomass. The half-century that followed saw a further increase in the use of coal for industry, heating and transport. It also saw the slow expansion of car use and the development of aeroplanes. The two world wars were an important driver for technological development and the expansion of fossil fuel mining.  

By the end of World War II, the energy provided by coal had doubled again, it now provided almost twice as much energy as biomass. Also, the large-scale use of natural gas and oil really started take off. A mere two decades later, by the 1970s, oil had become the most important energy source, closely followed by coal and gas. This just goes to show how fast the energy landscape can change.

Since 1800, human energy use has increased 28-fold, and 82% of our energy is now provided by fossil fuels. Of course this enormous increase in global energy use is in part due to the more than seven-fold increase in world population over the last two centuries. If we factor this out and look at the daily energy use *per human*, the increase since 1800 has been somewhat more modest:
	
![]({filename}/images/energy-timeseries-per-person.png)

What you can see here is that the energy consumption *per person* has gone up too: it almost doubled between 1800 and 1950, and has doubled again since then. However, we can see that most of this second increase actually occured during the 1960s and 70s. This period saw the rise of energy-intensive consumer culture, personal car ownership and comfortable housing for small families, at least in the Western world. In the 1980s and 90s, recession and increases in energy efficiency temporarily halted the growth of personal energy consumption. Energy efficiency is still increasing, but unfortunately so is our energy consumption in this age of digital gadgets, datacentres, cheap air travel and increasingly heavy cars. This has led to a renewed increase in personal energy use over the last 15 years.

#### The kWh and other animals

Two centuries ago, in 1800, an average human was estimated to use just over 16 kWh per day. A century ago this had increased to just over 24 kWh per day. Today, the average person uses around 60 kWh per day. Before we continue, what is this kWh-thing exactly? The kiloWatt-hour (kWÂ·h or kWh) is a measure of *energy*. But how much energy exactly? Let's look at a few examples (click on the image for more details).

[![]({filename}/images/energy-kwh-explained.png)]({filename}/pages/energy-kwh-explained.md)

As for the terawatt-hour unit (TWh) I mentioned earlier, 1 TWh is 1 billion kWh. So we humans currently use over 430 billion kWh of energy *per day*. That's a very large number, and a very large amount of energy. Then again, there are over 7 billion of us on this planet, so we are a lot of people. This is why I will mostly talk about average energy use per person.

I've been talking about this figure of 60 kWh per person per day, but actually that's a bit misleading. This is the *average* energy use of a human being, but very few people are average human beings. In fact, most humans use less energy than average. But if you're reading this, chances are that you don't belong to this group. In fact, you probably use quite a bit more energy than average.


#### We are not average

As you can see in this figure, countries and regions vary quite a lot in how much energy they use per person:

![]({filename}/images/energy-tpes-iea-2014-kwh-person-day.png)

The red bar in this figure is the average worldwide energy use. Most countries above it are either relatively wealthy, or they have a lot of industry or oil reserves. Most countries below it are lower-income countries. And most people live in low-income countries. In fact, three quarters of humanity lives in Asia (around 51.7%), Africa (15.5%) and Latin America (8.6%). Asians use 40 kWh/person/day, but if you leave out China the average drops to 22, and in a country like Bangladesh it's only 7 kWh. Africans use 21 kWh/person/day, but someone in Central Africa uses only 8.5, and in some countries it's even less than 5 kWh/person/day. And most of the energy used in Africa is actually firewood for cooking. It seems that there is a strong relationship between "development" and energy use[^HDI]. A minority of humans use most of the world's energy supply, while most people still use as much energy or less as humanity did a century ago.

To be fair, the level of "human development" certainly isn't the only factor in energy use. Climate and geography play an important role in our need for energy. The countries where energy use per person is highest all have cold winters and/or warm summers and tend to have a relatively low population density. Such countries may need more energy for heating in winter or cooling in summer, and for transport year-round. And then there's industry, which also tends to require a lot of energy. This is especially important for a country such as China, which not only houses a fifth of the world's population but also most of its manufacturing industry. Many manufacturing processes require high temperatures, which in turn require a lot of energy. The industrial products are often meant for export, which means that the average Chinese person actually uses a lot less energy than shown in the figure above, while the average consumer in a Western country may use quite a bit more. 

Even if we don't count the "indirect" energy use from consumption, the differences in energy use between countries are sometimes enormous. For instance, the United States are home to a mere 4.4% of the world's population, less than Bangladesh and Pakistan combined. But the US uses over 16% of the world energy supply, while Bangladesh and Pakistan together use only 0.9%. The average North American uses over thirty times as much energy as the average Bangladeshi. It's obvious that energy consumption will be higher in countries with lots of public infrastructure, where most people have their own car and house, and where most building have heating or air-conditioning, compared to countries where people are struggling to get by. And if living conditions are to improve in a country like Bangladesh, energy consumption needs to *increase* there, rather than decrease. It would be rather unfair to say that such countries should not develop. But it would also be unrealistic to expect rich countries to voluntarily decrease their standard of living. As we shall see in later articles, they can actually decrease their energy use quite a lot without sacrificing living standards. But the energy problem is not only about *how much* we use, it is also about *where the energy comes from*. And in this respect there are significant differences between countries as well:

![]({filename}/images/energy-tpes-iea-2014-energy-sources.png)


Let's start with some similarities: Most countries shown here need quite a bit of oil, up to 9 litres per person per day, which comes down to between 10 and 86 kWh. This oil is used mostly for transport. On top of oil, most countries use a fair amount of coal, natural gas or nuclear energy, or a combination of these, to generate heat and electricity. Only very few countries use significant amounts of renewable energy. Iceland clearly stands out, being a volcanic island near the North Pole, with a tiny population and abundant supplies of geothermal energy. A few other countries in this figure also stand out when it comes to renewable energy. Norway gets around a third of its energy from hydro power, and Canada, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and New Zealand manage a little over 10%. [New Zealand also gets around 20% of its energy from geothermal sources.](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/statistics/renewables) 
But actually most renewable energy isn't geothermal or hydro-power, and it certainly doesn't come from solar or wind power.
Even in most advanced industrial countries, it turns out that the biggest "green" energy source is still firewood! This is followed in second place by waste material (including household waste and agricultural waste). In other words, most "renewable energy" comes from burning biomass and waste, much as it did 200 years ago. A country such as Finland has little hydro power and almost no windmills or solar panels, but it does have trees, lots of trees. As for some other countries:

<img src="{filename}/images/energy-country-consumption-countries-2013.png" />

</div>


While it can certainly be sensible to generate energy from waste and plant material, there's no way we can run our current high-energy societies on firewood. There simply aren't enough trees. We need sustainable energy sources that are more scalable. Let's therefore ignore energy generated from biomass and waste for a moment. If we do that, things actually look pretty dismal, at least when it comes to renewable energy. Worldwide, a little over 1% of energy comes from "other" renewable sources, including wind, solar and geothermal power. PV solar panels currently provide a little over 0.1% of global energy, which comes down to about around 0.04 kWh per person per day. A teaspoon of gasoline actually contains more energy than that.


My home country of The Netherlands does only slightly better than the world average, it derives 0.7% of its energy from renewable sources outside of biomass and waste. In the UK this is 1.5%. Even Germany, generally considered to be a front-runner, only gets 3% of its energy from wind, solar and hydro power, which incidentally is the same percentage as France. Spain and Portugal on the other hand, currently the poorest nations in Western Europe, do relatively well. Profiting from its relatively sunny climate, Spain is actually the European leader in solar energy at almost 2 kWh per person per day (2.4% of its energy consumption). That's still a small percentage, but Spain currently gets 9% of its energy from wind, hydro power, thermal solar power and PV solar power. Portugal even manages a little over 10%. Granted, European countries with higher mountains and more water still tend to do a little better (Norway, Sweden and the Alpine countries)[^easterneurope], mainly because they have more hydro-power. Still, it's interesting and hopeful to see that Portugal, Spain and even Greece (with 5.8%) are outperforming countries like Germany and Denmark in generating their energy from sustainable sources outside of biomass and waste. 

We can clearly see that we have a long way to go if we want to switch all countries to a renewable energy supply. Even if we do count biomass and waste, the percentages of renewable energy are very small compared to the amount of fossil fuels we use. Let's take The Netherlands as an example. It's a tiny country of some 17 million people. Bit it actually uses more oil than *nearly all of the of the 40+ countries in sub-Saharan Africa taken together* (if we exclude South Africa and Nigeria). And in fact, the wealth and economy of The Netherlands depend on it. We currently need large amounts of oil to power the millions of cars, vans, trucks, tractors and boats that transport our people and goods and work our land. And then there's all the coal and gas we use to heat our homes, offices and greenhouses, and to generate our electricity. Even a relatively small and wealthy country like The Netherlands would be hard-pressed to find sufficient alternative power sources to generate the more than 140 kWh per person per day[^primaryvsfinal] it currently gets from fossil fuels. And these figures don't even include the energy use of international air traffic and shipping. All these fossil fuels are the biggest reason why [an average Dutch person emits over 46 kg CO~2~-eq. of greenhouse gasses per day]({filename}/CO2/co2footprint.md).


#### Why is energy a problem?

First of all the supply of fossil fuels is not infinite. In fact, we haven't discovered any major new conventional oil fields since the 1960s, and oil and gas are increasingly mined from old reservoirs and non-traditional sources such as oil shale and tar sands. We're basically getting better at pulling fuel out of the ground, due to technical innovation. But this does come at a cost: The energy needed to get fossil fuels out of the ground is increasing, quite rapidly. For oil and gas it has more than doubled in the last 15-20 years. This is reflected in a measure called the energy return on investment, or EROI. The EROI tells us how much energy we get back for the energy we invest. It was as high as 33:1 for conventional oil and gas back in 1999, which means that for each kWh that we invested in looking for oil, pumping it out of the ground, and refining and transporting it, we ended up with a useful energy surplus of 33 kWh. By 2005 however, the global EROI of oil and gas had dropped to around 18:1, and it is still declining. For US shale gas the EROI was estimated at 12:1 a few years ago, but this is expected to fall sharply in coming years as initial "sweet spots" are depleted. Things get even worse when we make electricity from fossil fuels, because we lose more than half our energy in conversion and transport. Electricity generated from conventional gas actually has an EROI around 7:1, and electricity from shale gas is below 5:1. And this is a serious problem in the longer term, because the minimum EROI needed for the basic functioning of an industrial society is probably around 5:1. And that's really a minimum, if you want to sustain more complex public infrastructure such as education and healthcare, you probably need at least 10:1 or 11:1.[^eroisources] 
The falling global EROI means that if we stick with current energy sources and if we do not decrease the current level of energy use, it may become a real challenge to keep our industrial societies running in the near future (let alone to keep our economies growing).


So our high energy needs are a problem, especially in combination with decreasing energy returns and a growing world population. But there's a second and perhaps more pressing problem with our current energy situation, one that I already mentioned in the introduction. Every year, human activities release around 40 billion tonnes of greenhouse gasses (CO~2~-equivalent) into the atmosphere. An estimated 69% of these emissions are the result of burning fossil fuels. We know with certainty that these emissions have a warming effect on the Earth's climate. Apart from sea-level rise, we're not entirely sure what the exact effects of climate change will be in the longer term, as I discussed in an [earlier article](/co2.html). This in itself is a problem. Models suggest some fairly nasty possible scenarios, including significant disruption of agriculture and biodiversity in large regions. To avoid serious climate disruption, we probably need to keep the warming of the global climate below 2 degrees Celsius. And to do this, we'd probably need to keep the total amount of human greenhouse gasses emitted after 2011 below ... million tonnes. At current rates of emission, this "carbon budget" will be used up in 2036. Of course, if we manage to reduce our emissions, we may be able to stretch this budget a little longer. On the other hand, recent observations suggest that climate warming is be preceding a lot faster than predicted by the IPCC models (which were used to estimate the carbon budgets). If this is indeed the case, we may have only a decade or two left to basically reduce human greenhouse gas emissions to zero. Given our enormous dependence on fossil energy, this is going to be a extremely difficult undertaking. It would probably require a dramatic increase in the energy efficiency of just about every human activity, as well as large-scale carbon capture, reversing deforestation, decreasing consumption, scaling up wind and especially solar energy more than a hundred-fold over existing levels, and building a completely new infrastructure for global energy transport and storage. And this all has to happen in a very short period of time, a few decades at most. 

Following the Paris climate treaty, most governments have announced more or less ambitious goals to reduce fossil fuel use and scale up alternative energy sources. But it's going require hard work and significant investment to meet those goals. Given the extremely high energy requirements of industrialised societies, just putting a few solar panels on a roof somewhere isn't going to be enough to solve our energy and climate problems (by far, as I will discuss in a later article). 
It is actually dangerous to pretend that we can easily switch to renewable energy by just installing a few windmills and solar panels. It allows governments and corporations to get away with superficial and cosmetic measures, rather than making difficult, structural changes. Energy transition is not easy. New inexpensive large-scale energy sources will not magically materialise from research and innovation, at least not within the coming decades. Energy transition will require blood, sweat, tears and a lot of investment, from everybody, from governments to companies and public institutions, and from researchers to house-owners. It's time we started taking this more seriously, it's time we really got to work and it's time we all knew our numbers so we can actually be critical citizens.


#### So what have we learned?

We use *a lot* of energy, especially in industrialised countries that are located far from the equator. Currently, over 80% of this energy is derived from fossil fuels. Most of the rest is derived from burning firewood and waste materials. The widespread use of fossil fuels is actually a fairly recent development, it was established mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. Energy use in western, industrialised countries is much higher than elsewhere in the world. With a few exceptions (mostly countries with a lot of hydro-power), renewable energy sources outside waste and biomass provide only a *very* small fraction of the energy used in industrialised countries. Especially with regard to wind and solar energy there is certainly *a lot* of room for improvement.

In upcoming articles I shall explore in more detail why we use so much energy, and I shall look at which energy sources are capable of replacing the energy that is currently derived from burning fossil fuels.

**Footnotes:**


[^energyprices]:
The problem is of course that converting one form of energy to another always implies losses. The 10 kWh of energy that is in a litre of oil can only be fully extracted in the form of heat. If you take the energy in oil or coal or natural gas and convert it into electricity, you'll a quarter to a third of the energy in the conversion process, possibly even more. Still, in many countries electricity is also relatively cheap. In the US the [average electricity price](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/7?agg=0,1&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&endsec=vg&freq=A&start=2001&end=2015&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0) is only slightly over 10 dollarcents per kWh (a bit more for residential use). While oil was expensive in 2011, [this comparison of 2011 electricity prices](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html) shows that the relative cost of electricity (adjusted for purchasing power) was below 12 dollarcents per kWh in Canada, China and the US. Electricity is generally generated from coal and natural gas, the price of which is linked to oil prices but only loosely. Electricity prices are therefore typically not a very good refection of oil prices, or even fossil fuel prices. Moreover, readers who have followed [recent developments in solar energy costs](http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/abu-dhabi--three-world-record-bids-entered-for-sweihan-solar-project_100026191) will have noticed that the cost for solar-generated electricity has recently dropped below 3 sollarcents per kWh for some projects in the Middle East. 


[^HDI]:
There seems to be a reasonable correlation between a country's energy use and its [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index). 
The countries with the lowest energy use all score "low human development" (e.g. Niger, Eritrea, Senegal, South Sudan, Nepal) or at most "medium" development (e.g. Bangladesh). South Sudan is only a state since 2011, has been in civil war since 2013, and has ranked in the top-2 of the [Fragile States Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_States_Index) for the last three years.
The countries with above-average energy use nearly all rank as "very high human development" (e.g. Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, most European countries, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, Israel) or "high" development (e.g. Russia, Iran, Bulgaria, Ukraine, China, Venezuela, Thailand), with only few exceptions (e.g. South Africa).


[^china]:
Of course, there are some exceptions, such as China. Moreover, absolute energy use is still rather high for Asia and Latin America, simply because so many people live there. As people in the West often point out, China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as the world's biggest consumer of coal. This is true, but in fact most of this energy is used for making export products. And even if we would count everything as domestic energy use, the population of China is so big that it comes down to only around 72 kWh per person per day, just above world average but well below the energy use of European countries. 

[^easterneurope]:
Albania: 34.35%	renewables, 25.32% hydro, 0.5% solar
Also look up Bosnia and Croatia
Note that this is mostly hydro.
However, NL is outperformed by Romania:
Romania: 1.2% wind, 0.11% solar


[^primaryvsfinal]:
Mention primary vs. final energy use. Primary fossil fuel use is >140 kWh/person/day, final is much less, around 90 kWh/person/day. So sustainable energy sources have it a little easier. But This does not count imports and international traffic.

The 33:1 (1999) and 18:1 (2005) for oil and gas were from Gagnon et al. (2009), http://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fen20300490
The 12:1 estimate for US shale gas is based on Yaritani & Matsushima (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en7042207
The minimum EROI-numbers are based on an interview with Charles Hall.
"If you've got an EROI of 1.1:1, you can pump the oil out of the ground and look at it. At 1.2:1 you can refine it and look at it. At 1.3:1 you can move it to where you want and look at it. [...] You need at least 3:1 to drive a truck. If you want to put grain in the truck, you need 5:1. To include the truck-driver, oil-worker, farmer and their families, you need 7:1. If you want education, you need 8:1 or 9:1. If you want healthcare, you need 10:1 or 11:1."
Some sustainable energy sources have a high energy return on investment, such as hydro-energy (more than 40:1) and wind energy (over 20:1 and rising). Modern PV solar energy generators still have a fairly low EROI of around 6:1 (this can be higher or lower, depending on location). Also this figure is increasing, but unfortunately batteries and other forms of storage are expected to significantly degrade this EROI again in the near future. Electricity from coal has a fairly stable EROI around 18:1, but carbon capture and storage may decrease this by around a third. Nuclear electricity has a rather variable EROI, which on average is fairly low (around 5:1) due to the extremely high energy costs of mining uranium, building and maintaining nuclear power plants and storing nuclear waste.
