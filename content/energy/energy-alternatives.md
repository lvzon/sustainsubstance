 - Recap: we use a lot of energy, and most of it is fossil. Only a very small percentage is currently renewable.
 - Previous article showed that most renewable energy comes from biomass and hydropower, and for some countries geothermal.
 - The problem that there is a limit to how much energy we can get from these "big 3" renewable sources.

Show extended picture of energy and electricity production, mark fossil vs. alternative sources (add total percentages and mark electricity percentages of alternative sources).

2013: hydro: 2.4%, nuclear 5%, and biomass + waste 10%. But notice that the latter two mostly create heat. When we only look at electricity production, hydro provides 16%, nuclear 13% and biomass a mere ...%.

Clearly hydropower is good at generating electricity, so let's start with that.

 - Hydropower is very attractive in theory, but large-scale hydro has a lot of problems.

In many ways, hydroelectric power is a very attractive form of extracting high-quality energy from the natural water cycle.
It is a relatively simple technology, that can produce very cheap electricity on a large scale, and hydroelectric reservoirs can also be used to store energy where there is a surplus of electricity, so they play an important role in matching supply and demand of energy. Revervoirs can also have an important role in storing water for drinking and irrigation and in flood control.

The principle of hydro-energy is fairly simple, it basically harvests solar energy by using gravity and the water cycle. The sun drives the water cycle by evaporating water, which falls back down to the earth's surface as rain or snow and flows back into the oceans in streams and rivers. If we have a sufficiently large height difference somewhere (which generates higher water pressure), and/or a large volume of flowing water, we can use the water pressure to drive a turbine, which drives a generator, which then produces electricity. (http://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/hydropower/hydropower-learning-centre/head-and-flow-detailed-review/)

The most (economically) efficient way of extracting energy from a river is often to build a large dam across it, creating a large lake that can provide significant water pressure for all of most of the year. However, such large hydroelectric energy projects obviously cannot be established everywhere, and they also have sigificant drawbacks. The most obvious drawback is that a lot of space is required for the lake, and that the natural hydrology of a region is disrupted. There are around 800,000 hydroelectric dams in operation worldwide, and together these facilities take up an area roughly the size of Italy. Traditional large hydro projects can have large negative impacts, which may include the forced displacement of native people, flooding of large natural and agricultural areas, changes in local climate, increased risk of landslides, floods and disease, depletion of biodiversity, sedimentation problems upstream from the dam and water shortages, loss of soil fertility, salinisation and coastal erosion downstream of it. Many of these problems are [well-documented](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/environmental-impacts-hydroelectric-power.html#.WnMD4vZG3rc) for large projects such as the [Aswan Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan_Dam#Effects) in Egypt and the [Three Gorges Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam#Environmental_impact) in China.

Good governance and proper management of water flows and upstream areas (especially reduction of soil erosion) may reduce or prevent negative social and environmental effects of large hydro projects to some extent. Unfortunately the negative effects on biodiversity are harder to prevent, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Flooding valleys in such regions can actually wipe out entire species of plants and animals that don't exist elsewhere. Also, large hydropower projects tend to involve corruption, and in some cases even the murder of local activists. Profits from such projects often go to companies building and operating the facilities, while normal people bear most of the negative impacts. Moreover, hydroelectric dams in tropical and some temperate areas can become significant producers of greenhouse gasses, due to the decomposition of organic material.

TODO: look up murder of activists

https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/drugs-dams-and-power-the-murder-of-honduran-activist-berta-caceres/
https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/defenders-earth/
Global witness reported threats, violence and even murder related to several hydro-power projects in 2016.

It is estimated that in Europe and North America, over 70% of exploitable potential for hydroelectric power is already operational. In Africa, Asia and Latin America there is still a lot of unexploited potential for large scale hydroelectric projects, but given the potential negative impacts of the technology it is probably very unwise to exploit all of this potential, especially if this would involve large projects in countries with corrupt governments and high biodiversity. 

Apart from large-scale hydro projects, there is still a lot of global potential for building smaller hydroelectric installations. Smaller hydro projects tend to have less negative impact and obviously require much less investment. On the other hand, smaller installations are less economical, and studies show that the accumulated impact of many small installations may actually be bigger than that of a single large project. In any case, it is expected that most of the growth in hydroelectric energy production the coming decades will probably be in relatively small-scale installations (less than 10 MW). TODO: source?

-> Not true probably, see https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technology-roadmap-hydropower.html
The potential for additional hydropower remains considerable, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This roadmap foresees, by 2050, a doubling of global capacity up to almost 2 000 GW and of global electricity generation over 7 000 TWh. Pumped storage hydropower capacities would be multiplied by a factor of 3 to 5.
Most of the growth in hydroelectricity generation will come from large projects in emerging economies and developing countries. In these countries, large and small hydropower projects can improve access to modern energy services and alleviate poverty, and foster social and economic development, especially for local communities. In industrialised countries, upgrading or redevelopment of existing plants can deliver additional benefits.
In order to achieve its considerable potential for increasing energy security while reducing reliance on electricity from fossil fuels, hydropower must overcome barriers relative to policy, environment, public acceptance, market design and financial challenges.
Large or small, associated with a reservoir or run-of-river, hydropower projects must be designed and operated to mitigate or compensate impacts on the environment and local populations. The hydropower industry has developed a variety of tools, guidelines and protocols to help developers and operators address the environmental and social issues in a satisfactory manner.
New turbines and design make modern hydropower plants more sustainable and environmentally friendly; better management helps avoid damage to downstream ecosystems.
Hydropower projects require very substantial up-front investment, which can range up to tens of billion USD. Although hydropower is the least-cost renewable electricity technology and is usually competitive with all alternatives, financing remains a key issue.


TODO: one study finds that many small-scale plants, besides being less economical, also have a large overall cumulative impact: http://www.cedren.no/Portals/Cedren/Pdf/EcoManage/EcoManage_brukerm%C3%B8te_2014_7_Sammenligning_sm%C3%A5_stor_vannkraft_vind.pdf?ver=2014-02-03-130906-887

TODO: more information
[small scale hydropower in India](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/29/small-scale-hydropower-india-clean-energy-climate-change-environmental-impacts) and [micro-hydro in Wales](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/16/community-hydropower-schemes-under-threat-at-expense-of-local-jobs).

Besides "traditional" hydro-energy techniques that involve large height-differences and rapidly rotating turbines, there are also ways of extracting energy from large volumes of slow-flowing water. For instance, [large waterwheels](http://www.english.oryonwatermill.com/) can be placed horizontally on the bed of larger rivers without much apparent impact on fish or ships. Wave generators and tidal power installations can harvest energy from the movement of seawater along coastlines, and "blue energy" installations can generate electricity from the salinity differences between fresh water and seawater. While there is certainly potential in generating energy from such "alternative" hydro sources, it is limited to specific locations along large rivers and coastlines, and the amount of energy that can be produced is fairly limited.

TODO: references for wave energy, tidal energy and blue energy   

All in all, hydro energy will probably remain an important and relatively clean energy source, but its potential for significant growth as an energy source is rather limited. If we want to move away from fossil fuels, hydro power alone isn't remotely capable of filling the energy gap.

The second big "alternative" energy source, nuclear energy, has at least two things in common with hydro power: it tends to involve large government-funded projects, and a single installation can produce a huge amount of energy. In the 1950s, "the power of the atom" was imagined to provide humanity with an almost limitless supply of cheap energy. The first commercial nuclear power plant started operating in 1954, and at the height of the "atomic age" there were serious plans to build nuclear-powered [trains](), [cars](), [zeppelins]() and even [aeroplanes](). Some people even imagined that future humans might travel around the country in a [nuclear-powered hotel and shopping centre](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/trade-your-trouble-for-a-bubble-19741043/). Obviously, the "nuclear dream" didn't quite live up to its promise. Nonetheless, especially France, the Soviet Union and the United States built a fair number of nuclear power plants in the decades that followed, especially in the 1970s and '80s. Today, there are some 440 operational nuclear power reactors in 30 countries. Together these can generate over 390 GW of electricity, at least in theory.

Nuclear power tends to be associated with advanced physics, but actually the operating principle of most nuclear power plants is fairly simple. Some have called nuclear power "a very complicated, expensive and dangerous way to boil water". The complicated part is in acquiring sufficient amounts of nuclear fuel and then starting and subsequently controlling a nuclear fission reaction. The heat that is released from this reaction is generally used to boil water, and the resulting steam drives a turbine, which drives a generator, which produces electricity. (Some may start to see a common theme here...)

While certainly complicated and expensive, nuclear fission does have the potential to generate a lot of energy, and nuclear energy has a surprisingly good safety record if you look at the number of deaths per kWh generated. 
TODO: reference and numbers
The problem of course is that accidents, while rare, can have *very* serious consequences, including uncontrolled chain reactions and the contamination of large areas with radioactive material. Over the past decades there have been a few serious accidents, the best known of which were the Fukushima disaster in 20.., the Tchernobyl accident in 198.. and the Three Mile Island explosion in 19.. TODO: look up references and some details.
Lesser known, however, is the much larger number of small accidents and near-accidents that occured over the past half century. TODO: look up some numbers
Especially the Fukushima accident contributed to a large drop in public acceptance of nuclear energy. Nonetheless, around 50 new reactors are currently being constructed, especially in Asia, and another 160 to 300 are planned for the coming decades. In Europe and the US however, the number of operational reactors is decreasing, and while the life of existing installations of oftend extended by upgrades, there are few plans to build new reactors here.

Apart from questions of safety and low public acceptance, "traditional" nuclear power stations suffer from a number of problems.

As of 2014, there have been more than 100 serious nuclear accidents and incidents from the use of nuclear power. Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and about 60% of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the USA.[8] Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961).[9]
Social scientist and energy policy expert, Benjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define major energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages.[8] Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and almost two-thirds (56 out of 99) of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the US. There have been comparatively few fatalities associated with nuclear power plant accidents.[8]

https://www.laka.org/docu/ines/
Today, the Laka-foundation released a list with reports from almost 1,000 incidents and (near) accidents with nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. Since 1990 the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has gathered these reports.

http://www.dw.com/en/incidents-and-accidents-in-nuclear-power-plants-when-are-they-really-dangerous/a-19094877
This is how the different levels are defined, according to the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
To grasp incidents that have no immediate relevance for security, but which could eventually lead to more severe further incidents if neglected, there is a definition for a level 0 incident.
 Such events are rather common. For example, in the year 2014, there were 68 notifiable events of level 0 in all of Germany's nuclear facilities.
The lowest form of an incident is an "anomaly" (level 1). This can be the case if a faulty component such as a damaged power generator triggered a shut down of the reactor. Also, a severe mistake in the management of power plant rules and processes can be qualified as a level 1 incident. Throughout all of the 1990s, there were 75 such events in Germany.
A real "incident" (level 2) occurs when there is a significant failure in safety provisions. In such cases, another part of the safety infrastructure will step in, like in the case of the 2014 Fassene event. Other examples could include the failure of an important water pump or a dangerously low Boron concentration in a flooding container. Such level 2 incidents are rare. Throughout the 1990s, Germany's nuclear facilities reported only three of them.
A "serious incident" (level 3) involves the leaking of a small amount of radioactive material into the environment. This usually means an exposure of personnel to radioactivity, resulting in contamination or health problems. This always involves the failure of several parts of the safety provisions. Such events are extremely rare even on the global scale, happening around once a year around the world.
 An accident with local consequences (level 4), an accident with wider consequences (level 5) or a serious accident (level 6) mean that a significant amount of radioactive material has been released. The different levels are differentiated by the severity of radiation and the number of casualties. If the radioactivity of the spilled substances amounts to hundreds of Terabecquerels (1 Tbq = 1 Trillion radioactive fission processes per second), or if there is at least one fatality, the accident will be considered level 4.
If the radiation is at least 100 times higher, or are there several fatalities, the accident is level 5. Level 6 is reserved for accidents with tens of thousands of Tbq and widespread contamination.
Generally speaking, accidents around nuclear facilities are rare. Level 4 accidents include the partial meltdowns in the French power plant Saint-Laurent in 1969 and 1980. The Three-Mile-Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979 was classified level 5, after a third of the reactor core melted then - but could be contained. The release of radioactivity led to a considerable increase of cancer rates downwind from the reactor by as much as 150 Percent.
An example of a level 6 accident was the massive release of radioactive substances from a military nuclear plant in Majak in Siberia in 1957. More than 10.000 people in the sparsly populated area had to be resettled. Today, Majak is considered the third most severe accident of the nuclear era.
Since nuclear power was invented, there were two catastrophic accidents (level 7): Chernobyl in 1986, and 2011 in Fukushima. Both accidents saw a complete meltdown of one (Chernobyl) or more (Fukushima) core reactors.



TODO: number of serious accidents and near-accidents. Describe effects of the most serious ones: Tschernobyl and Fukushima. Accidents and near-accidents show that systems are always fallible, so there is always some risk of damage that is so large that nobody is willing (or able) to insure it. Nuclear installations are very expensive to build, and investors don't like risks. So while private companies often build and operate the installations, governments bear the risks, often also financially. Financial risks are in many ways more problematic, due to unknown costs of future waste disposal, increasing costs of uranium, uncertainty in the energy market with regard to electricity prices and the unpopularity of nuclear installations with the public. Also, after half a century, we still don't really know what to do with the waste fuel, and dexomissioning turns out to be much more difficult and expensive than anticipated when the installations were built. In fact, no installation has been successfully decomissioned. Probably, there is not much of a future for "old school" nuclear installations, simply because nobody wants to invest.




This doesn't mean that nuclear fission energy is entirely dead, of course. There are some interesting new technologies, which may solve some of the problems surrounding fuel, safety and waste.

TODO: Mention examples

The main problem with such new technologies is that they are nowhere near ready for "prime time". There are only a few small, experimental installations, and quite a few technical challenges still need to be overcome to scale these up, which is expected to take at least a decade or two. Moreover, the issues with cost remain, and some new problems are created, notably the risk of nuclear proliferation. All in all, it seems very unlikely that nuclear energy will be able to take over from fossil fuels on the timescale needed to avoid serious climate problems.

TODO: Describe recent development in fusion: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/nuclear-fusion-on-brink-of-being-realised-say-mit-scientists
   Bob Mumgaard, CEO of the private company Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has attracted $50 million in support of this effort from the Italian energy company Eni, said: “The aspiration is to have a working power plant in time to combat climate change. We think we have the science, speed and scale to put carbon-free fusion power on the grid in 15 years.”
However, fusion experts don't see this timeframe as being realistic.
   The planned fusion experiment, called Sparc, is set to be far smaller – about 1/65th of the volume – than that of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, an international collaboration currently being constructed in France. The experimental reactor is designed to produce about 100MW of heat. While it will not turn that heat into electricity, it will produce, in pulses of about 10 seconds, as much power as is used by a small city. The scientists anticipate the output would be more than twice the power used to heat the plasma, achieving the ultimate technical milestone: positive net energy from fusion.
Note that this is a huge step forward, but nowhere near having a working generator, let alone scaling it up.

Existing nuclear installations will be around for a while, and in future there may certainly be a role for modern nuclear fission in a diverse energy system. And in an even more distant future we may even be able to obtain energy directly by nuclear fusion, which (in theory) doesn't have the problem of requiring radioactive fuel and producing nuclear waste. However, the technology required for that probably will take another half century or so to perfect and scale up.




So hydropower cannot be scaled up significantly, and the contribution of nuclear energy is more likely to decrease than increase. What about biomass, the third of the "big" non-fossil energy sources? Biomass (together with the rather vague energy source of "waste") still provide 10% of the world's energy, more than at eny point in human history. But much of this biomass is basically firewood. Wood is a great energy source when well managed and burnt in a modern, efficient device at a small scale. However, burning firewood at a large scale is not such a great idea, given problems like deforestation and air quality. More people die from open-air cooking and heating than from any other energy source. Another problem is that wood grows only very slowly, but burns very fast. 

TODO: can we give some numbers?
~4.5 kWh embodied thermal energy per kg wood (not all recoverable)
A 25 year old pine tree absorbs 6.82 kg of CO2 annually. Wood is heterogeneous and exact amount of carbon in 1 Kg of dry wood will vary depending on the species of wood, age of wood etc. It is reported that 1 Kg of wood contain about 450 to 500 gm of Carbon. This means 1 Kg of wood is holding about 1.65 to 1.80 Kg of CO2.
So, if all CO2 is converted into wood, a 25 year old pine tree would produce up to 4 kg of wood per year, which would yield at most 18 kWh of thermal energy.
Old trees add biomass faster (10-200 kg per year)
A 1kW fire would burn for around 1.5-3 hours on 1kg of wood, and therefore yield ca. 1.5-3 kWh of heat.
So 4 kg of wood would burn for 6-12 hours (assuming a 1 kW fire).

Wood fuels handbook:

1kg of wood chips generate 2.5-4.5kWh, depending on moisture content

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/15/trees-grow-more-older-carbon
"In absolute terms, trees 100cm in trunk diameter typically add from 10-200 kg dry mass each year averaging 103kg per year. This is nearly three times the rate for trees of the same species at 50cm in diameter, and is the mass equivalent to adding an entirely new tree of 10-20cm in diameter to the forest each year," said the report.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/194367/how-big-is-a-1kw-fire
Basically ~330kg of wood per hour (or double that for wood that isn't dried properly, or open fire with a lot of heat loss)

https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/4594/how-much-firewood-does-it-take-to-produce-the-equivalent-of-1kwh-of-electrical-h
So it takes roughly 0.67 - 0.85 lbs (304 to 386 grams) of firewood to equate to 1 kWh of electric heat.
If we're assuming a regular hardwood used typically for firewood (here in the UK at least), which has a net calorific value of 4.06 kwh/kg at a moisture level of 20%, if this is burnt in a stove with an efficiency level of 70% then it is safe to calculate that it would take a 0.352kg piece of firewood to produce 1kWh of electricity.
If the moisture content of the firewood was 10% then it would take a 0.307kg piece of firewood to produce 1kWh of electricity.

How much energy does it take (on average) to produce 1 kilogram of the following materials?
Wood (from standing timber): 3-7MJ (830 to 1,950 watt-hours).

https://teeic.indianaffairs.gov/er/biomass/restech/uses/howmuch/index.htm
The biomass production rate in terms of the quantity of biomass that can be grown on a parcel of land per unit time (generally given as kg of biomass per hectare per year or kg/ha/yr) varies greatly depending on the crop, soil type, availability of water, and so forth. (1 hectare is 10,000 square meters [m2] or about 2.5 acres.) The numbers also vary depending on the moisture content of the crop at the time the measurements are taken. Some representative yields of oven-dried wood and other biomass are:
Wood 10,000–20,000 kg/ha/yr
Given an average yield of 15,000 kg/ha/yr and an energy content of 15 MJ/kg (4.17 kWh), the amount of thermal energy that can be expected to be available from cultivated wood production would be about 225,000 MJ/ha/yr (62500 kWh), which would be about the same amount of energy contained in approximately 7,500 kg of coal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_fuel#Measurement_of_firewood
A common hardwood, red oak, has an energy content (heat value) of 14.9 megajoules per kilogram (6,388 BTU per pound), and 10.4 megajoules recoverable if burned at 70% efficiency.[4]
The Sustainable Energy Development Office (SEDO), part of the Government of Western Australia states that the energy content of wood is 16.2 megajoules per kilogram (4.5 kWh/kg).[5]

There are plants that grow a lot faster and that can be used to produce fuels with a high energy density. The most well-known are crops such as corn/maize and sugar cane, which can be used to produce ethanol (alcohol), and oil crops such as oil palm and rapeseed, which can be used to produce biodiesel. After a brief period of popularity at the beginning of this century, it turned out pretty quickly that the negative impacts of using agricultural crops for fuel are in most cases a lot worse than the carbon emissions to which they are a "solution". First of all, biofuels actually require quite a lot of fossil fuels to produce, as crops need to be grown, harvested, transported and processed. Also, biofuel crops need quite a lot of agricultural land, which is often degraded by monoculture (so that fertiliser and pesticides are needed as well). Even worse, oil palm plantations usually involve cutting down rainforest, which is obviously a bad idea by any standard.

So "agricultural" biofuels are a bad idea, and wood should be used with care and in limited amounts. Using agricultural "waste" as an energy source is possible, either directly or by converting it to biogas. But also this has limited potential, and while it doesn't require dedicated land, it does tend to break the nutrient cycle, so in the long term using plant "waste" can create nutrient shortages.

Significant growth in biofuels would have to come from new techniques, notably growing genetically modified algae. The advantage would be that no land is needed, no soil is degraded, and the energy produced is easy to store and use in traditional combustion engines. However, algae would still require nutrients to grow, and they remain a fairly inefficient way of capturing sunlight. Also, large algae monocultures would probably be susceptible to disease, which would pose entirely new risks to our energy supply and could cause all kinds of environmental problems related to pesticide use. In short, it seems that also biofuels offer only limited potential for growth as an energy source.

It is clear that in the energy system of this century, the role of fossil energy sources will gradually have to diminish. Unfortunately, it seems that no single energy source (with the possible exception of nuclear fusion) will be able to provide energy that is currently provided by coal, oil and natural gas, and it is therefore likely that energy transition will be toward a diverse energy mix. Hydro power, nuclear fission and biomass will certainly have a role to play in this future energy mix, but there are many reasons to believe that this role will be (and should be) limited and cannot grow much beyond their current contribution. The energy required to replace fossil fuels and to allow for better living conditions across the world will mostly have to come from relatively new sources. Solar, wind and geothermal energy currently play a minor role in global energy production, together providing around 1% of all energy we consume. As we shall see in our next articles, there is a lot of room for growth in the use of these young energy sources, especially solar energy and to a lesser extent wind energy. 

However, we should remember that no technology is impact-free, and we need also to be able to store and transport all this energy, which is going to be a challenge.

TODO: perhaps mention some of the potential? How much of the earth's surface would we need to cover in solar panels to replace fossil fuels? Or in windmills? Also mention the potentials of wind and geothermal. 

Let's assume ~2000 kWh/m2/year or solar irradiance (e.g. South Spain or North Africa), and say we can capture 15% of this (which is optimistic), we could generate ca. 300 kWh/m3/year. 
Existing estimates: 
http://landartgenerator.org/blagi/archives/127
496,804,500,000 square meters or 496,805 square kilometers (191,817 square miles) as the area required to power the world with solar panels. This is roughly equal to the area of Spain. According to the United Nations 170,000 square kilometers of forest is destroyed each year. If we constructed solar farms at the same rate, we would be finished in 3 years.
it would require 11,748,294 of the 5 MW capacity turbines to create the same yearly output. There are 500 million cars in the world so it's not like that's an unattainable goal from a manufacturing standpoint. And each 5 MW turbine is a 30 year lifespan money making machine for whoever buys it. The same can not be said for my car. But if we can build 90,000 Cape Wind size installations, we would be there on wind alone. Based on that installation, each turbine requires 1/2 square mile of area for offshore sites. This would require 5.85 million square kilometers for 2030 world energy needs.

Now, if we cover an area of the Earth 335 kilometers by 335 kilometers with solar panels, even with moderate efficiencies achievable easily today, it will provide more than 17,4 TW power. This area is 43,000 square miles. The Great Saharan Desert in Africa is 3.6 million square miles and is prime for solar power (more than twelve hours per day). That means 1.2% of the Sahara desert is sufficient to cover all of the energy needs of the world in solar energy.

Modern wind turbines can be build fairly cheaply and quickly, and don't require a lot of energy to build. Current wind technology has the potential to provide around 80% of the energy currently provided by fossil fuels, but we would have to cover all suitable land and water surface area with windmills, which is probably a bad idea, so the actual contribution of wind energy would be some fraction of this. Say we'd cover around 20% of suitable surfaces (which is already quite a lot), we would be able to replace around 16% of current fossil fuel energy production by wind.

Estimates of geothermal energy potential vary widely. It is considered possible by some to produce up to 8.3% of the total world electricity with geothermal resources (Fridleifsson et al., 2008), which unfortunately would replace only a fairly small fraction of current fossil fuel use (TODO: estimate how much). Probably in many applications it would be wiser to use geothermal heat directly to replace use of electricity and fossil fuels for heating, because the conversion to electricity is not very efficient. 

Solar is a different story. On an average day, the earth's surface receives ... kWh solar energy per square meter. So if we would be able to capture this energy with perfect efficiency, we'd need around ... m2, or ... % of the earth's surface to replace all fossil fuel use. In practice, we're not able to capture all solar energy of course, we can currently capture a bit over 20% as electricity and a bit more as heat, and there would be significant overhead in storing the captured energy and for transporting it to where it is needed, as well as in production and maintenance of installations. So in practise we'd need several times more surface area. And some care should be taken in choosing locations, as it's not well known what effect large numbers of solar panels would have on local climates and biodiversity. But still, compared to the entire surface of the planet, we'd need a fairly modest surface area to replace all fossil fuels. As alternative energy sources go, solar energy has by far the most potential as a serious energy source.


Switching away from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources certainly won't be easy, as we use a lot of fossil energy, we are quite dependent on it for our current lifestyles and we will require land surface and infrastructure to generate this energy in other ways. Also, there are certain conditions that need to be met when it comes to energy storage, transport and efficiency. Nonetheless, transition to new energy sources is at least theoretically possible. However, it would be a lot easier if we would change our energy consumption patterns and levels. Also here there is a lot of room for improvement, as we shall see in the next article.
