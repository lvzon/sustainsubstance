 - Largest "sustainable" sources: Biomass, hydro, geothermal. Problem is that these are mostly not very scalable, and may have serious side-effects which impact their sustainability. Advanced biofuels may hold some promise for scaling up, but would disease and nutrient cycling could be an issue, and it remains inefficient (but cheap).
 - Examine the promise of nuclear energy (historically, currently and from a technical perspective: a very complicated, expensive and dangerous way to boil water). Probably EROI is too low and costs and risks are too high to make it a large-scale alternative. Governments and private companies no longer want to bear the risks and costs (which are increasing), and decomsissioning and waste problems remain unsolved as of yet. Plants have long lifespan and safety is increasing, but more are going offline than are coming online. 
 - Fourth generation reactor technologies are more interesting, but remain in experimental stage and many problems still have to be solved. Not expected to be commercially viable for another few decades.
 - Likewise, fusion is very interesting but still too far away. We cannot wait that long.
 - Main energy sources that still can be seriously scaled up: Wind and especially solar. There is some potential for wave and other "blue" energy as well as watermills, but it is limited. 
 - Wind is faily efficient and has low payback time. But requires space and windy places, and are not without impact (e.g. on birds and landscape). Main limiting factor: NIMBY, people do not like large noisy windmills, so they are limited to low-density areas and sea (which poses challenges for maintenance.)
 - Solar is a serious candidate, given how much solar energy we receive. Main problems are: requires surface area, availability often does not match demand, and current panels are still expensive, fairly inefficient and require energy to produce and maintain. Increasing investment does mean more technological development, theoretical increases in efficiency are still significant and some could probably be brought to market within a decade or so. Weak points in practice are electronics (life-span and management of inverters) and energy storage (at large-scale).
 - Scaling up is certainly possible, but matching the current energy use is going to be very tricky. People who claim that energy will be abundant and free have not done their homework. More likely is that energy will be in short supply and therefore more expensive, if we are serious about phasing out fossil fuels. But if we can manage to reduce our current consumption this would solve at least part of the problem. Why do we need so much energy, and what are the opportunities for reduction?
