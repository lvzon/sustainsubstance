We humans currently use over 430 billion kWh of energy *per day*. That's a very large number, and therefore a lot of energy. And it begs the question: What do we use all this energy for?

The figure above shows where our energy comes from, and what we use it for. Let's take a closer look at it. We already talked a little about where our energy comes from, so we'll start with the right side: Where does the energy go?

For most of us, including myself, this figure reveals a rather stunning surprise: Almost a third (31%) of our energy supply isn't really used for anything! Part of this energy goes into the mining process of fossil fuels. The rest goes into transport and storage, or is lost in conversion: in refining fuels, in converting them to electricity and transporting this electricity. 

Another 10-14% or so of our energy supply (up to three-quarters of the "transport" energy) is lost due to the inefficiency of internal combustion engines. This means that only around half of our energy supply (±55%) is effectively available for use by us humans. And we can probably assume that much of our use of this is also unnecessarily wasteful, but let's ignore that for now (I will talk about that in a later article).

A small fraction, around 6% of our fossil fuel supply, is not used for energy but is used for the production of plastics and other materials. We actually use less than half of our global energy sources (44%, or 24 kWh per human per day) to power all our industry, services, infrastructure, agriculture and our houses. Of this energy, about three quarters is used in the form of heat, and around a quarter is currently used in the form of electricity. A further 5% or so of our global energy supply (roughly 3 kWh per human per day) is effectively used to move stuff and people around (if we don't count the energy lost as heat in combustion engines).

These figures are strange if you think about them for a bit. How can we use only 24 kWh per person per day for almost everything we do, including all our work and infrastructure, if the average electrified home already uses 10 kWh of electricity per day? Also the energy available for transport won't get us very far, perhaps 10 km per person per day, and that's including air traffic. Most of us reading this will travel a lot more on average, as does the stuff we buy. 

The reason for the figures being so low is of course that some people and countries use a lot more energy than others. Most humans live in Asia and Latin America and Africa, where energy use per person is a lot lower than the average depicted here.[^china] Conversely, energy use in regions like North America, Europe and Australia is a lot higher than average. 60 kWh per person per day is not nearly enough to power your average industrialised consumption society. Moreover, countries vary quite a lot in their energy sources:

With regard to energy sources, an average person in France or Germany will use more than twice the world average, over 125 kWh per person per day. And that's not even counting the energy needed to make imported products. An average Australian uses over three times the world average, and an American uses more than four times the average. Someone in Central Africa on the other hand, uses only 8.5 kWh per day on average. This is a tiny fraction of the global average, and most of that is actually in the form of firewood for cooking.  

*Africans use 16 kWh/day, while North Americans 258, and Europe is somewhere in the middle.
Also large differences between countries within a given region.
For instance within Africa, most of the energy is used by just a few countries. In Central Africa, energy use is 8.5 kWh/person/day, just over half the continent’s average. But in Chad, Burundi, Eritrea, Mali and Niger, it is under 1 kWh/person/day.
The Netherlands alone uses more oil than the 40+ countries in sub-saharan africa together (minus South Africa and Nigeria), which have 30 times more people.*


So, we've established that much of our energy is actually lost to inefficiencies, and that there are large differences in energy use between regions and countries. Let's go back and look at where our energy comes from. Globally, oil and coal each make up just under a third, and natural gas makes up about a fifth. Together, these fossil fuels make up most (82%) of our energy supply, and nuclear energy provides another measly 5%. The remaining 13-14% or so of energy sources are what we would call renewable energy sources. For most people this immediately conjures up images of windmills and solar panels. In fact, this renewable energy is almost all provided by biomass and various kinds of waste, which form around 10% of total global energy supply. Hydropower contributes another 2.4%, and sources such as geothermal energy provide most of the remainder. Windmills currently provide a rather pathetic 0.3% of the global energy supply, and PV solar panels even less, around 0.1%. PV solar panels currently provide as much energy per person per day as is in a teaspoon of crude oil. This is roughly enough to boil every person on Earth a bit under half a litre of water per day (430 mL to be precise, at least in 2013). That's great if we could live on two cups of tea, but obviously we still have quite some way to go if we want to get rid of fossil fuels, especially if we'd like to power our economies and creature comforts using mostly solar energy and wind power.

*About those regional and country differences: 
In Africa, most energy comes from biomass, mostly wood used for cooking.
In Europe and the US, it’s quite a different picture.
What these countries have in common is that they use a lot of oil, at least double the world average (?), most of which is for transport.
Most use some combination of coal and gas for electricity, heating and industry.
Some exceptions: Lot of nuclear in France, lot of hydro power in Norway (provides most of the “green” electricity in Northern Europe), lot of natural gas in NL (has to do with greenhouses).
US just uses a lot of everything.
Another thing most of these countries have in common is the small contribution of renewable energy. Norway has a lot of hydro and some wind, but together this still makes up only a third of its energy use. In most other countries, this figure is a lot lower, and most of the “renewable” energy comes from biomass.
Even Germany, often hailed as the renewable energy miracle, actually only gets 3% of its energy from wind, solar and hydro power.
Dismally low figure in relatively wealthy countries such as NL (0.7%) and UK (1.5%)
Spain, currently one of the poorest nations in Western Europe, does relatively well, and is actually the European leader in solar energy with almost 2 kWh per person per day (2.4%)*



It is not uncommon these days for policy makers and politicians to boast about the growth of the renewable energy sector in their countries. However, the above figure shows some things that we rarely hear about. Germany and Norway are often praised for being frontrunners in renewable energy. However, if we look at fossil energy use per person, both countries actually do rather badly compared to some of their European neighbours. A German uses twice the world average in fossil fuels, a Norwegian even more. In Europe, only the Netherlands and Luxemburg do worse when it comes to fossil fuels used per person. The average Frenchman or Spaniard or Greek actually does a lot better when it comes to fossil fuel use: at or slightly above the world average. And Spain in particular does quite well when in comes to non-biomass renewable energy: 9% of its energy supply already comes from wind energy, hydro power, thermal solar power and PV solar power. The expansion of renewable energy sources in countries like Germany and Denmark is certainly important, but their contribution is still tiny relative to fossil fuel use. If we really want to make progress, perhaps we should start ranking countries according to how much fossil energy they still use per inhabitant, rather than by the fraction of electricity generated by biomass, windmills and solar panels, which tends to make things look better than they really are.



*With regard to Spain: Only Denmark has a higher percentage of wind power (5.4%), and Spain uses more solar energy per person (2.4%, almost 2 kWh/day) than Germany (1%, 1.3 kWh/day), although most of it is thermal rather than electrical.* 

TODO: check Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, Luxemburg, and mark hydro separately for Spain
Should we add Denmark as well?


*So, what do we learn from this? Firstly, we use a lot of energy, especially in "developed" nations. Why? We use/need energy to drive to work, to the supermarket, drive the children to/from school, drive or fly to our holiday destinations, build roads, build houses and offices, heat them, cool them, run computers and servers, farm food, transport food, store food, and produce the mountains of other stuff we constantly buy. In a small village in Africa, South America or Asia, this will probably be a different story.*

*Second, almost all of this comes from fossil fuels, with only a few exceptions. Almost none is provided directly by solar or wind. Especially solar lags behind: world-wide, less than a percent, and for western countries, even the leading ones, it is rarely more.* 

*Third, we waste most of our energy, almost certainly more than half, probably closer to 75%. Most losses occur in energy conversion and in the transport sector, but large efficiency gains are possible in industry and houses and offices as well. As losses are so significant, if we manage to reduce energy losses and waste, we'd be well on our way to slash our energy consumption.*

*Fourth, most of our energy is used in the form of heat, while sustainable energy efforts tend to be more focussed on electricity. Understandable, as you can easily convert electricity into heat. But it's a bit of a waste: electricity is hard to come by, while heat is relatively easy to come by, it is a by-product of nearly everything. Also, compared to electricity, it is relatively easy to store, although it is much harder to transport. More on the role of heat energy in later articles.*

*It seems that there is plenty of room for improvement, right?
In the next article I will examine the potential for non-fossil energy sources.*

[^china]:
Of course, there are some exceptions, such as China. Moreover, absolute energy use is still rather high for Asia and Latin America, simply because so many people live there. As people in the West often point out, China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as the world's biggest consumer of coal. This is true, but in fact most of this energy is used for making export products. And even if we would count everything as domestic energy use, the population of China is so big that it comes down to only around 72 kWh per person per day, just above world average but well below the energy use of European countries.
