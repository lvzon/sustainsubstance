Two centuries ago, in 1800, an average human was estimated to use just over 16 kWh per day. A century ago this had increased to just over 24 kWh per day. Today, the average person uses around 60 kWh per day. But what is this kWh-thing exactly? Well, the technical description would be this: If we take a device that draws 1000 Watts of power (1 kiloWatt), say a decent toaster/grill, 1 kiloWatt-hour (kWÂ·h or kWh) is the amount of *energy* that it will consume in one hour. So kWh is a measure of energy, and a fair amount of energy at that. For people who like standard units: 1 kWh is qual to 3.6 MJ (megaJoules). Let's look at a few examples. 

1 kWh of energy will keep my small 2000 W electrical space heater running for half an hour. It will keep an old-fashioned 40 W lightbulb burning for roughly 24 hours, and it's enough energy to boil a bucket of water.[^waterboiling] However, an average (gasoline) car will only drive around 1 to 1.5 km on 1 kWh of energy.[^carenergy] Being derived from crude oil, a litre of gasoline contains almost 9 kWh of energy (or 33 kWh per gallon). And a cubic metre of natural gas contains around 11 kWh (or 0.3 kWh per cubic foot).[^energycontent]    
Worldwide, an average electrified household uses around 10 kWh of *electricity* per day inside their home, although in Australia and France it's almost double this amount, and in the US and Canada it's easily three time this figure.[^electricityuse] 

There is also the terawatt-hour (TWh), which is used for really really large amounts of energy, such as the energy requirement of countries. 1 TWh is 1 billion kWh. We humans currently use over 430 billion kWh of energy *per day*. That's *a lot* of energy. 


[^waterboiling]:
Actually 10.75 L, starting from 20 degrees and assuming 1 kg of water per L and 4186 J per g per degree. 

[^carenergy]:
Average fuel efficiency is around 15 km/L in The Netherlands and [25 MPG in the US](http://www.autonews.com/article/20150604/OEM05/150609925/average-u.s.-mpg-edges-up-to-25.5-in-may) Assuming thatthere is 10 kWh of energy in 1 L of fuel, we get a driving range of around 1.5 km per kWh in The Netherlands. In the US, 40.2 km on 3.8 L gives us 10.6 km/L, or 1.1 km per kWh.

[^energycontent]:
Gasoline has an energy content of around [8.8 kWh/L](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ArthurGolnik.shtml). The energy content of natural gas varies somewhat per region, it is around [10.6 (10.3-11.4) kWh/m3](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/JanyTran.shtml).


[^electricityuse]:
Average electricity use in The Netherlands is around [8 kWh/day in The Netherlands](https://www.nibud.nl/consumenten/energie-en-water/), [30 kWh/day in the US](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3) and [17 kWh/day in France](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-electricity-consumption).
