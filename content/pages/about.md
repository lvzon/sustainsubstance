Let me introduce myself. My name is Levien van Zon, I have a background in environmental science and theoretical biology, I work in the sustainable energy sector and I've had a life-long fascination for the subject of sustainability. As most people, I struggle with this subject, which is both extremely important and extremely complex and difficult. This blog documents my search for a vision of what a truly sustainable society might look like, and what wee need to do to get there. What are the major obstacles, and what could conceivably be done to overcome them? How can we contribute, as citizens, as consumers, as employees, managers, entrepreneurs, farmers, voters, activists, parents and students, in general as people who participate in society and have to choose how we shape our vocation? 

The articles I write are rarely short, and they involve numbers (because numbers matter). However, I will try to make the articles as readable as I can. Currently, this website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi in my living room, so I apologise for the somewhat Spartan look and long loading times. As the content grows, I will probably migrate to a somewhat more professional platform. However, all articles on this blog can also be downloaded as an e-book or PDF file for offline reading at your leisure.

If you have any questions, suggestions or other types of feedback, don't hesitate to contact me via e-mail (feedback@sustainsubstance.com), Facebook or Twitter. Hateful comments will be ignored, but in all other cases I will try to get back to you!
