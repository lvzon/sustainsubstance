The goal of this website is to collect balanced, well-supported and where possible quantitative information on the sustainability aspects of our consumption and our behaviour. The site is meant to fill the gap that currently exists between superficial short articles on one hand, and tough reports and scientific articles on the other.


<img src="{filename}/images/levien-small.jpg" alt="Levien van Zon" style="float:right;padding-left:30px;border:none;"> *The Substance of Sustainability* is the personal research project of Levien van Zon. Levien is an Environmental scientist as well as a Theoretical Biologist, and he currently works in sustainable energy. However, as a consumer, he is just as confused as the rest of us.


The central question that interests me is the following: To what extent is true sustainability possible, and to what extent can we contribute to this as individuals?
It is not hard to show that our current society is in many ways not sustainable. To continue as we do now, business as usual, is not really an option in the long term. But in practise this does not happen, society is constantly adapting.
The reasons why our society isn't sustainable are also mostly known. But what alternatives do we have, and what choices do we need to make? This is not so clear, as things are rarely as simple as we'd like them to be. Opinions tend to differ greatly on the best way forward, and fact is that nobody can predict the future with certainty.
The primary goal of this blog is for me to form an opinion, guided by the information that is out there, and to share this with others.


This website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi and is still under development. We apologise for the somewhat Spartan looks and minimalist setup...
