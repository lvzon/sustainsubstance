The goal of this website is to collect balanced, well-supported and where possible quantitative information on the sustainability aspects of our consumption and our behaviour. The site is meant to fill the gap that currently exists between superficial short articles on one hand, and tough reports and scientific articles on the other.

*The Substance of Sustainability* is the personal research project of Levien van Zon. Levien is an Environmental scientist as well as a Theoretical Biologist, and he currently works in sustainable energy. However, as a consumer, he is just as confused as the rest of us.

*"Trying to be a conscious consumer, it is easy to lose the forest through the trees. Over the last two decades, I've spent a lot of time reading about sustainability. Yet, when people ask me something, I often simply don't know. This frustrates me. The subjects tend to be specialist and complex, reliable information is often hard to find and there's a lot of nonsense going around. It's fairly easy to say and write all kinds of fact-free hogwash when it comes to sustainability. Getting your facts straight turns out to be a lot harder. I also tend to go by what I read and hear elsewhere, which often includes contradictory information. I want to know for myself what the ins and outs are of energy use and production. I want to know how my consumption influences land use and the wellbeing of others. I would like to be able to set priorities in reducing my own footprint. The reason why I started this project is so I can try to dig up the information I need."*

This website is still under development. We apologise for its somewhat Spartan looks and minimalist setup...
