Data source for the period 1800-1970: Max Roser (2016), [Energy Production & Changing Energy Sources](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/), which in turn cites Vaclav Smil (2010), [Energy Transitions: History, Requirements, Prospects](http://vaclavsmil.com/2010/03/01/energy-transitions-history-requirements-prospects/).

Data source for the period since 1971: [IEA Headline Energy Data](http://www.iea.org/statistics/), total primary energy supply.

Note that there is some discrepancy between the estimates from both data sources, which explains the slight jump in the graph from 1970 to 1971. The IEA-estimates for oil are around 20% higher, while the IEA-estimates for renewables are up to 20% lower.
