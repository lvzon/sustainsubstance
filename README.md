## The Substance of Sustainability

This is the git-repository of the website hosted at <https://sustainsubstance.org>

The Substance of Sustainability is a personal research project that looks at what would be needed for human societies to be truly sustainable. What can we learn from complex natural systems in this regard? And which alternative stories can we tell about sustainability, that may actually help rather than hinder us?
